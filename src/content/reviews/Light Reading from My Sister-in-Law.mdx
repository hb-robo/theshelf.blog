# Light reading from my sister-in-law

I'm 29 years old and I barely read. That's pretty much the reality.

It wasn't always like this - actually, it couldn't be farther from how I grew up. I just sat through an embarrassing holiday dinner wherein my family gushed about how early I could read, how I couldn't be found without a book in my hands, etc., etc. They remember it fondly and still envision reading as a core part of my identity.

High school lit classes, video games, and the advent of smartphones, in some order, probably led to the end of that. STEM education in college didn't exactly nurture the habit, either.

I missed reading as I fell out of love with it, but in a shallower sense: I didn't want to read as much as I wanted to be well-read. To be *seen* like that. It was an ugly feeling. It represented some out-of-reach intellectual prestige I saw across the internet in the late 00s and early 10s, like I was living in the bar scene from  *Good Will Hunting* or something.

Still, pre-TikTok social media was basically all text. Over my terminally online era (2013-2022), I was probably reading more words per day on socials than most people in human history got to parse through in their life. A lot of which was inane or unintelligible, sure, but like they say in sports scouting, getting reps is the most important thing. I guess I can claim to be well-read in some postmodern respect, but not a "reader." Strange times.

It's not the same thing though, obviously. There's only so many times you can see people talking about, say, Marx online before you have to just read the thing yourself. You start to wonder if you really know anything about anything, or just internalized a constellation of other people's interpretations that you hope are true. I can't live like that, so I'm back in the business of flipping pages.

To get back into the habit, I decided I would just read anything and everything until it felt normal. I was also going to try for physical books, to cut down on screen time before bed (and to potentially slot on The Shelf). 

The day after Christmas, I was errantly declaring this plan aloud at my fiance's parents' place when my sister-in-law pulled out a huge wicker basket of finished books. She and their mother are voracious readers - they clean up dozens of books a year each, often swapping the finished ones to the other. The secret to their prolificity is that they know what they like - romance and true crime thrillers - and they don't care if it's good. 

I wasn't brave enough to go for any smutty stuff this time, but I asked my SIL to pick out a few of her favorite thrillers for me. After about 5 minutes of deliberating "hm"s and "well..."s, she landed on three books. If I was going to be serious about my plans, I had to go in with an open mind and see them through.
