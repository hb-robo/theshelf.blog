### my writing process

I jot notes in a small spiral-bound notebook entitled "CAPTURE", if possible while experiencing some kind of art media. In the case of an event, like a movie theater showing, the notes are taken afterwards for obvious reasons. I use a standard four-color pen to distinguish the media type - the colors the media take on the site actually match the ones in the pen!

Periodically, the notes are reviewed and synthesized into larger thoughts. Sometimes, even smaller thoughts - I have done intentionally small word count limits in the past as a writing exercise.

## ratings and outcomes

For any given work covered in an article, there will be two results tied to it: a score, 1-10, that attempts to capture my sentiment towards the work; and a "shelf outcome" - that is, if and how any decisions were made regarding ownership of the work as physical media.

### a note on rating systems

I recognize that in practice, the assignment of numbered grades to works of art is reductive and ultimately meaningless. However, I maintain that it is useful as a tag of sorts. I am less interested in what a given work "deserves" in a vacuum than I am in how I feel about it relative to others. So in that respect, the scores themselves are an expression of my learned sense to distinguish merit among large quantities of works - something like z-scores.

Despite this futility, I have attempted to define, roughly, what each score tries to signify. Half-scores therefore represent a level of indecision between two sentiments. The scale is as follows.

1. Actively repulsive or hostile. Regret experiencing it. The work fails on a fundamental ethical or experiential level.
2. Incompetent to the point of frustration or tedium. Fails at basic execution. Not interesting, even as a curiosity.
3. Incompetent; a clear failure with occasional ideas or moments. Can still be interesting as a curiosity.
4. Shoddy, but with some considerable merits. Net negative experience, but not a waste.
5. Possibly remarkable, but ultimately mediocre. Positives and negatives balance out.
6. Competent with notable positives, but clear flaws hold it back. Slightly net positive and engaging, but nothing special.
7. Compelling. Holds attention consistently with clear creative vision, but has identifiable weaknesses or unrealized potential.
8. Excellent with impact. Emotionally resonant, structurally sound, leaves a lasting impression. Occasional blemishes don't diminish the experience.
9. Masterful. Everything serves the vision. Deeply affecting with execution that feels inevitable. Lacking the final transcendent push.
10. Transcendent. Shifts perspective or creates an experience that feels unrepeatable.

In the past, I've had many accounts on art criticism platforms like Letterboxd, Backloggd, RateYourMusic, etc., and my rating distribution is a pretty even normal curve around 5.5. Because of this, it is exponentially less likely for a work to move further away from the center. I do not aim for a specific curve, though, and will not bend scores or include any similar meta-context of the platform in a score.
