		<p>The complete scale with reflective symmetry:
			1 - Actively repulsive or hostile. Regret experiencing it. The work fails on a fundamental ethical or experiential level.
			2 - Incompetent to the point of frustration or tedium. Fails at basic execution. May be interesting as a curiosity, but the experience is net negative.
			3 - Incompetent but has ideas or moments, OR was competent but retroactively soured. The failure/souring outweighs any positives.
			4 - Incompetent execution with considerable merit in concept/ambition, OR competent but fundamentally uninteresting. Net slightly negative but not a waste.
			5 - Competent and unremarkable. Positives and negatives balance out. Baseline—it exists and does its job.
			6 - Competent with notable positives, but clear flaws hold it back. Net positive and engaging, but nothing special.
			7 - Compelling. Holds attention consistently with clear creative vision, but has identifiable weaknesses or unrealized potential.
			8 - Excellent with impact. Emotionally resonant, structurally sound, leaves a lasting impression. Minor flaws don't diminish the experience.
			9 - Masterful. Everything serves the vision. Deeply affecting with execution that feels inevitable. May lack the final transcendent push.
			10 - Transcendent. Shifts perspective or creates an experience that feels unrepeatable. Experiential factor exceeds structural perfection.
