# [theshelf.blog](theshelf.blog)

A media criticism blog revolving around games, albums, and films competing for space on The Shelf.
Writeups focus on the experiential aspects of the works and the various physical forms the work inhabits.

## Project Structure

The blog is written in Astro with Tailwind, so the writeups themselves are directly written as Markdown and converted into full pages at build time.
